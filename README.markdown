pyOAuth
======

pyOAuth is a Python library for dealing with OAuth.

It gives you, the developer, full control over everything that is
going on. That means you can:

  * Write logic to re-use HTTP connections and perform much better
  * Control exactly what parameters get sent and how
  * Support out-of-band verifier codes
  * Use Python's HTTP facilities to their fullest extent (for example,
    file uploading)
  * Feel confident using a library that has been fully unit-tested

The code behind the library tries to be simple and easy to understand,
while refering to the relevant sections in the OAuth specification
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849). So, unlike other libraries, this
is one that you can follow along with and learn more about OAuth from.

Examples
--------
In the examples directory, there are examples of how to use the
library. The canonical one is 3-legged OAuth with the Twitter API.
