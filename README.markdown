iOAuth
======

iOAuth is a Python library for dealing with OAuth.

It gives you, the developer, full control over everything that is
going on. That means you can:

  * Write logic to re-use HTTP connections and perform much better
  * Control exactly what parameters get sent and how
  * Support out-of-band verifier codes
  * Use Python's HTTP facilities to their fullest extent (for example,
    file uploading)

Also, the code behind the library tries to be simple and easy to
understand, while refering to the relevant sections in the OAuth
specification (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849). So, unlike other
libraries, this is one that you can follow along with and learn more
about OAuth from.

Twitter Example
---------------
Here is an example of interfacing with Twitter (make you to grab your
own application credentials first).

    from ioauth import Consumer
    from ioauth import token_from_string
    from ioauth import parse_path, parse_host, parse_port, parse_qs_real
    from urllib import urlencode
    import httplib

    request_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'
    access_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token'
    authorize_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize'
    example_data_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/friends/ids'
    consumer_key = ''
    consumer_secret = ''

    consumer = Consumer(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
    params = {'oauth_callback': 'oob'}
    signature = consumer.sign_request(request_token_url, 'POST', params)
    headers = {'Authorization': signature.get_header()}

    conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(
        parse_host(request_token_url),
        parse_port(request_token_url))
    conn.request('POST', parse_path(request_token_url), '', headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()

    body = response.read()
    conn.close()

    request_token = token_from_string(body)

    print 'Go here: '
    print '%s?oauth_token=%s' % (authorize_url, request_token.key)
    print
    oauth_verifier = raw_input('Enter the OAuth Verifier: ')

    conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(
        parse_host(request_token_url),
        parse_port(request_token_url))
    consumer = Consumer(consumer_key, consumer_secret, request_token)
    params = {'oauth_verifier': oauth_verifier}
    signature = consumer.sign_request(access_token_url, 'POST', params)
    headers = {'Authorization': signature.get_header()}
    conn.request('POST', parse_path(access_token_url), urlencode(params), headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    body = response.read()
    access_token = token_from_string(body)

    consumer = Consumer(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token)
    signature = consumer.sign_request(example_data_url)
    headers = {'Authorization': signature.get_header()}
    conn.request('GET', parse_path(example_data_url), '', headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    body = response.read()
    print body
    conn.close()

More Examples
-------------
In the examples directory, there are more examples of how to use the
library. Given that I like Beatport, I have included full examples of
how to use both types of OAuth with Beatport's public OAuth API.
